Note that /complex project now is for Section 14 k8s complex

The former project Section 11 is now using /complex-elastic-beanstalk-final and NOT /complex

############
The repo for /complex pointing to github dmastrop/multi-docker is to be used with /complex-elastic-beanstalk-final and NOT with /complex any longer.  Do the following:

###########
On /complex-elastic-beanstalk-final verify remote "complex" is using dmastrop/multi-docker:

davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex-elastic-beanstalk-final % git remote -v
complex https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git (fetch)
complex https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git (push)
davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex-elastic-beanstalk-final % git remote show complex
* remote complex
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git
  Push  URL: https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)

############
On /complex (which is to be used for complex k8s):
Remove the remote repo complex immediately to avoid overwriting the project above.

davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex % git remote -v
complex https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git (fetch)
complex https://github.com/dmastrop/multi-docker.git (push)
davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex % git remote remove complex
davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex % git remote -v
davemastropolo@Margarets-MacBook-Air complex % git remote show complex
fatal: 'complex' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

will add a remote repo "complexk8s" for /complex k8s project in training module 251

########
on /complex-elastic-beanstalk-final note that deployed dockerhub images are 

    - run: docker push dave123456789/multi-client-10-14
    - run: docker push dave123456789/multi-nginx-10-14
    - run: docker push dave123456789/multi-server-10-14
    - run: docker push dave123456789/multi-worker-10-14

The other images on dockerhub for the multi-client are for the /complex project of Section 14 and the same images above *-10-14 can also be used for kubernetes Section 14 as well. They have been verified as working locally with a rebuild:


#########
in /complex-elastic-beanstalk-final/client directory for example, to rebuild multi-client from scratch:

docker build -t dave123456789/multi-client .
docker push dave123456789/mulit-client   to push to dockerhub.
